# Block isn't touch draggable until first selecting

    Repro: Add block and try to drag it.
    Expected: Block is dragged.
    Actual: Block is selected.

# Quantity control should position at last block of top body part if that is the only body part.

    Repro: Add top offset and reduce quantity so that there is no mid or bot body parts.
    Expected: Quantity outline is around last block in top body.
    Actual: It is around the last block of the width.
    Desc: This happens because mid was (incorrectly) assumed to always exist in View.BodyModel.

# Blocks can "disappear" when resizing the screen.

    Repro: Use a phone in portrait orientation then rotate.
    Expected: Blocks should move into a visible part of the grid.
    Actual: They are offscreen.
